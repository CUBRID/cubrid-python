Change from 8.4.1.0001 to 8.4.0.0001
 1. APIS-91 - Fetchone get numeric data's type is not correct
 2. APIS-93 - The format of Cubrid Date/Time/Timestamp string are different from Python's

Changed from 8.4.0 to 8.4.0.0001
 1. Added support for python 2.4 and 2.5
 2. Modified cursor.next_result() function
 3. Added test case test_next_result() in test_cubrid.py

Changes from 0.5.0 to 8.4.0
 1. Modified the architecture of CUBRID Python API, supported two-level interface.
    The high-level interface was a package, called CUBRIDdb, which respected the
    standard defined in the DB API 2.0 and was a wrapper around _cubrid. 
    The low-level interface was a module, called _cubrid, which exposed nearly the
    entire native client interface of the database engine.
 2. Upgraded thread safety to level 2 (according to the Python DB API 2.0) as in
    internal project required the ability to share the module and the connection
    between threads.
 3. Modified the parameters of module.connect() function.
 4. Added functions Date(), Time(), Timestamp(), DateFromTicks(), TimeFromTicks()
    and TimestampFromTick() (according to the Python DB API 2.0) in CUBRIDdb and
    _cubrid.
 5. Added functions ping(), server_version(), client_version() order in
    _cubrid.connection to providing information about server and client.
 6. Added functions(set_autocommit() and set_islation_level()) and attributes
    (autocommit, isolation_level, lock_timeout and max_string_len) in
    _cubrid.connection to get or set the attributes of CUBRID server.
 7. Added functions insert_id() and schema_info() in _cubrid.connection.
 8. Added global constants in _cubrid, which used in the functions
    connection.schema_info(), connection.set_isolation_level, cursor.execute(),
    lob.seek().
 9. Added functions in _cubrid.cursor, prepare(), bind_param(), bind_lob(), execute(),
    affected_rows(), fetch_row(), fetch_lob(), data_seek(), num_fields(), num_rows(),
    row_tell(), row_seek(), result_info(), next_result().
 10.Added simple usage example as requested by many people.
 11.Modified README
 12.Added HISTORY file to the distribution.
